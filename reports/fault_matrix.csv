"ID","Failure","Probable Cause","Affected Files","Severity","Dependency Chain","Status"
"1","Flask App Crash on Prediction","/api/predict_single_race endpoint crashes with 500 error.","Logger method mismatch: app.py calls logger.info and logger.error, but EnhancedLogger provides log_process and log_error.","app.py, logger.py","Critical","Blocks all prediction functionality via the API.","Unresolved"
"2","Flawed ML Model Predictions","ML model produces uniformly low and useless predictions (e.g., 0.0001 probability).","Schema mismatch in feature engineering, incorrect data scaling, or a bug in the feature calculation logic. The new unified DB schema is not correctly handled by the prediction code.","prediction_pipeline_v3.py, ml_system_v3.py, *.pkl model files","High","Provides misleading and incorrect predictions, which is worse than no predictions at all. Affects all downstream analysis and betting suggestions.","Unresolved"
"3","Database Schema Mismatch","Application code not updated for the new unified database schema.","The database schema was unified, but the Python code still references old table/column names or structures. This is the likely root cause for Failure #2.","app.py, prediction_pipeline_v3.py, ml_system_v3.py, and any other DB-interacting module.","Medium (Root Cause)","This is the root cause of the data-related failures. Resolving this should fix the ML prediction issue.","Unresolved"
