# Database Quality Assessment Summary
*Generated: 2025-08-21*

## Executive Summary
The comprehensive database assessment has identified **11 critical issues** affecting data integrity and model performance across 44 tables containing 71.1MB of racing data.

## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ High Priority
1. **Missing Winner Names**: 11,716 races (91.3%) without winner names
2. **Winner Name Mismatches**: 886 cases where winner names don't align with race results  
3. **Field Size Mismatches**: 2,285 discrepancies between expected and actual field sizes

### üü° Medium Priority  
4. **High Null Rates**: Significant missing data across key tables:
   - `race_metadata`: 91%+ null rates for weather, track conditions, prize money
   - `dog_race_data`: Missing odds, trainer data, performance ratings
   - `dog_performances`: 100% null rate for odds data

5. **Data Completeness**: 
   - Weather data: 91.3% missing across race records
   - Track conditions: 99.4% missing 
   - Race timing: 99.9% missing for most races

## Impact Assessment

### ML Model Performance
- **Winner Labels**: 91.3% of races lack ground truth labels
- **Feature Quality**: Missing weather, track conditions affect predictive power
- **Training Data**: Severely limited labeled dataset for supervised learning

### Data Integrity
- **Orphaned Records**: Clean - no dangling references found
- **Schema Consistency**: Good - proper relationships maintained
- **Duplicate Detection**: Previously resolved

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Winner Name Collection**: 
   - Repair race result scraping to capture winner names
   - Implement winner name validation against box analysis data
   - Priority: ~11,716 races need winner labels

2. **Data Source Validation**:
   - Cross-reference winner names with `box_analysis` JSON data
   - Verify field size calculations against actual participants

3. **Feature Engineering Impact**:
   - Weather features unusable for 91% of races
   - Track condition features unusable for 99% of races
   - Consider alternative data sources or imputation strategies

### Model Training Implications
- **Current Usable Data**: ~1,123 races with complete winner information
- **Model Performance**: Likely limited by insufficient training data
- **Feature Selection**: Must account for high null rates

## Database Health Score: ‚ö†Ô∏è 6.2/10
- **Data Completeness**: 3/10 (High null rates)
- **Data Accuracy**: 7/10 (Some mismatches found)  
- **Data Consistency**: 8/10 (Good schema integrity)
- **Data Timeliness**: 8/10 (Recent extraction timestamps)

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize winner name data repair
2. Implement data quality monitoring
3. Consider alternative labeling strategies
4. Update ML pipelines to handle missing data patterns
