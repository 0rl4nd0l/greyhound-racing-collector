## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Investigate Single Dog Races**: Review the 3,898 races with only one dog to determine:
   - Are these races with actual single runners (rare but possible)?
   - Are these data collection failures?
   - Are these incomplete scraping results?

2. **Data Collection Review**: Examine data collection processes for:
   - Venues with high single-dog percentages (GRDN: 40.6%, DUBO: 36.2%)
   - Specific distances showing high incompleteness (431m: 58.1%, 520m: 38.9%)
   - Lower grade races which show higher incompleteness rates

3. **Zero Dog Race Investigation**: Investigate the 7 races with no dog data at all

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Data Validation Rules**: Implement validation to flag races with unusual dog counts
2. **Source Verification**: Cross-reference with official racing authorities
3. **Automated Monitoring**: Set up alerts for data completeness thresholds
