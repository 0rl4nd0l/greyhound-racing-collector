- Core tables: `dog_race_data` (16,447 samples), `race_metadata` (races)
- Data retention: 2,455 races after quality filtering (19.1% kept from raw data)

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **HIGH:** Duplicate race/box combinations in dog_race_data
2. **HIGH:** Missing winner names in race_metadata (affects labeling)
3. **HIGH:** Winner name mismatches between metadata and results
4. **MED:** High number of missing starting prices (affects EV calculations)

**Data Quality Filtering Results:**
- Win rates by field size are perfectly calibrated (✅)
- Temporal ordering preserved with no leakage detected
- Reasonable venue and grade distribution

### 3. Pipeline Performance

**Functionality Tests:**
- ✅ MLSystemV4 import and instantiation
- ✅ Temporal feature builder operational  
- ✅ Data preparation (283 train, 70 test samples in 11.02s)
- ✅ Prediction interface working (returns valid probabilities)
- ✅ Model loading from registry successful

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Data preparation: ~11s for 50 races (acceptable for batch processing)
- Prediction latency: Sub-second for individual predictions
- Memory usage: Reasonable for model size

### 4. Feature Engineering

**Current Features (34 total):**
- Distance, venue, grade, track conditions
- Historical performance metrics (avg position, win rate, time consistency)  
- Venue and distance-specific statistics
- Temporal features (days since last race, race frequency)

**Temporal Safety:**
- ✅ Temporal feature builder prevents future data leakage
- ✅ Time-ordered train/test splits maintained
- ✅ Feature engineering uses only historical data
