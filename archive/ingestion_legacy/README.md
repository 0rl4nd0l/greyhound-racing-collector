# Legacy Ingestion Scripts

**Warning:** The Python scripts in this directory are archived and are no longer in active use. They are preserved for historical reference and to aid in debugging or understanding the evolution of the data ingestion pipeline.

**Do not run these scripts.** They may be incompatible with the current database schema, reference outdated APIs, or produce unexpected side effects.

If you need to restore a script from this archive, please use the `tools/archive_redundant_sources.py` script with the `--reverse` flag to ensure it is moved back to its original location safely.
