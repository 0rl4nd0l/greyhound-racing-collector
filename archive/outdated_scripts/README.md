# Archived Outdated Scripts

This directory contains prediction scripts that have been superseded by the new prediction pipeline.

## Archived Scripts (moved 2025-07-30)

### Prediction Scripts
- `comprehensive_prediction_pipeline.py` - Superseded by prediction_pipeline_v3.py
- `gpt_prediction_enhancer.py` - GPT enhancement now integrated into pipeline v3
- `weather_enhanced_predictor.py` - Weather prediction now part of pipeline v3
- `unified_predictor.py` - Replaced by prediction_pipeline_v3.py with better architecture
- `integrated_race_prediction_system.py` - Functionality merged into pipeline v3

### Utility Scripts  
- `fix_nan_predictions.py` - Data quality fixes now part of ml_system_v3
- `fixed_prediction_scoring.py` - Scoring improvements integrated into pipeline
- `upcoming_race_predictor.py` - Basic predictor replaced by pipeline v3
- `update_all_predictions.py` - Batch processing now handled by pipeline orchestrator
- `fix_probabilities.py` - Probability fixes integrated into pipeline
- `organize_upcoming_races.py` - Race organization utility
- `organize_races_by_time.py` - Time-based race sorting utility
- `scrape_and_organize_races.py` - Combined scraping/organizing utility
- `organize_existing_races.py` - Existing race organization utility

## Current Active Pipeline
- `prediction_pipeline_v3.py` - Primary prediction interface with intelligent fallback hierarchy
- `ml_system_v3.py` - Core ML prediction engine
- `pipeline_orchestrator.py` - Manages batch prediction workflows

## Migration Notes
These scripts were moved to maintain project cleanliness while preserving functionality in the new integrated pipeline system.
