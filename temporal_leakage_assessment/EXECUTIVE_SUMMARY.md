# Temporal Data Leakage Assessment Report
## Greyhound Prediction Pipeline Fix

**Assessment Date:** 2025-08-03 22:13:31

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHT
Post-race features are NOT inherently bad - they become leakage only when used to predict the SAME race they come from.

## 📊 CURRENT SITUATION
- **Total Races Analyzed:** 3
- **Date Range:** 2025-07-20 to 2025-08-22
- **Post-Race Features Found:** 14
- **Pre-Race Features Available:** 17

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

### The Problem:
Current ML pipeline likely uses post-race features from the SAME race being predicted, causing artificially high accuracy.

### The Solution:
1. **EXCLUDE** post-race features from target race
2. **INCLUDE** post-race features from historical races (proper usage)
3. **IMPLEMENT** strict temporal separation in feature pipeline

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX
- Model accuracy will drop from inflated levels to realistic 60-70%
- Historical performance features will still contribute valuable information
- Real-world prediction performance will match backtest performance
- System will work reliably for upcoming race predictions

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
1. **CRITICAL**: Update ml_system_v3.py feature creation methods
2. **HIGH**: Implement temporal validation in training pipeline  
3. **MEDIUM**: Add historical feature computation for predictions
4. **LOW**: Optimize feature engineering for historical data
