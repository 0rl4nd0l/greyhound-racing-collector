# FastTrack Integration Guide

## 1. Setup Prerequisites

To successfully scrape data from FastTrack, you must bypass their bot detection measures. This involves:

*   **CAPTCHA Bypass**: The mechanism for this is still under development, but it will likely involve a third-party service.
*   **Session Cookies**: You will need to extract valid session cookies from a browser that is logged into FastTrack. These cookies must be included in the headers of your requests.

**Note:** These prerequisites are critical. Without them, your requests will be blocked.

## 2. Usage Examples

### 2.1. Initializing the Scraper

```python
from src.collectors.fasttrack_scraper import FastTrackScraper

# Initialize the scraper with a rate limit of 1 second between requests
scraper = FastTrackScraper(rate_limit=1.0)
```

### 2.2. Fetching Race Data

To fetch data for a specific race, use the `fetch_race` method with the race ID.

```python
race_id = 123456789  # Replace with a real race ID
race_data = scraper.fetch_race(race_id)

if race_data:
    print(race_data)
```

### 2.3. Fetching Dog Data

To fetch data for a specific dog, use the `fetch_dog` method with the dog ID.

```python
dog_id = 987654321  # Replace with a real dog ID
dog_data = scraper.fetch_dog(dog_id)

if dog_data:
    print(dog_data)
```

### 2.4. Loading Data into the Database

The `fasttrack_adapter` module provides functions to map the scraped data to your SQLAlchemy models and load it into the database.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from src.collectors.adapters.fasttrack_adapter import adapt_and_load_race

# Assuming you have a database session object
db_session = Session()

# Scrape the race data
race_data = scraper.fetch_race(race_id)

# Adapt and load the data
if race_data:
    adapt_and_load_race(db_session, race_data)
```

## 3. Roll-out Checklist

Before activating the FastTrack integration in a production environment, complete the following steps:

1.  **Implement CAPTCHA Bypass**: Develop and test a reliable method for bypassing CAPTCHA challenges.
2.  **Implement Cookie Management**: Create a system for extracting, storing, and refreshing session cookies.
3.  **End-to-End Testing**: Write and run integration tests that cover the entire process, from scraping to database insertion.
4.  **Data Validation**: Compare the scraped FastTrack data with data from other sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
5.  **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track the success rate of your scraping and data loading processes.
6.  **Error Handling**: Ensure that your code gracefully handles errors such as network issues, blocked requests, and changes to the FastTrack website.
7.  **Proxy Integration**: Integrate a proxy rotation service to minimize the risk of being blocked.
