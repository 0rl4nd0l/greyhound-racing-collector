# Greyhound Racing Predictor

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Greyhound Racing Predictor system - an AI-powered platform for analyzing and predicting greyhound racing outcomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Greyhound Racing Predictor is a sophisticated machine learning system that combines:

- **Advanced Data Pipeline**: Automated collection and processing of racing data
- **ML Model Governance**: Champion/challenger model deployment with automatic rollbacks
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and performance tracking
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints for predictions and system management
- **Web Interface**: Interactive dashboard for monitoring and analysis

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Installation**: Set up the environment and dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Configure database and API endpoints
3. **Training**: Train your first ML model
4. **Predictions**: Make predictions on upcoming races
5. **Monitoring**: Track performance and system health

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

### Model Governance
- **Champion/Challenger System**: Automatically promote better-performing models
- **Rollback Protection**: Automatic rollback on performance degradation
- **A/B Testing**: Run multiple models concurrently for comparison
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track accuracy, precision, and ROI metrics

### Data Pipeline
- **Multi-source Ingestion**: FastTrack, sportsbooks, and weather data
- **Real-time Processing**: Automated data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation and integrity checks
- **Unified Schema**: Consistent data model across all sources

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus Metrics**: System performance and model metrics
- **Health Checks**: Automated monitoring of system components
- **Alerting**: Proactive notifications for issues
- **Performance Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of key metrics
