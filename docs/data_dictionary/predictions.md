# Predictions

The prediction system in the Greyhound Racing Predictor employs multiple methodologies and strategies to provide accurate race outcome forecasts.

## Prediction Methodologies

### Strategy Pattern Implementation

The system implements a Strategy Pattern with multiple prediction strategies:

1. **PredictionPipelineV3**: The latest ML system incorporating advanced features and Bayesian optimization
2. **ComprehensivePredictionPipeline**: Comprehensive analysis pipeline with multiple data sources
3. **UnifiedPredictor**: Unified interface with intelligent fallbacks and compatibility layers
4. **WeatherEnhancedPredictor**: Weather-enhanced predictions incorporating meteorological data

### Prediction Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Race files are validated and preprocessed
2. **Feature Engineering**: Multiple feature groups generate comprehensive feature sets
3. **Model Selection**: The appropriate prediction model is selected based on data availability and performance
4. **Prediction Generation**: Models generate predictions with confidence scores
5. **Post-processing**: Results are formatted and enhanced with additional metadata

### Champion/Challenger System

The system implements a robust model governance framework:

- **Champion Model**: The currently deployed production model
- **Challenger Model**: Newly trained models being evaluated
- **Automatic Promotion**: Champions are promoted based on ROC AUC thresholds
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic fallback if live performance degrades

### Real-time Predictions

- **Streaming Interface**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time prediction updates
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple predictions can be processed concurrently
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching reduces computation time for repeated requests

}
```

## Performance Monitoring

- **Accuracy Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of prediction accuracy
- **Drift Detection**: Automated detection of model performance degradation
- **Feature Drift**: Monitoring for changes in feature distributions
- **API Integration**: Real-time performance metrics via `/api/check_performance_drift`

The prediction system is designed to provide reliable, accurate, and real-time forecasts while maintaining high availability and performance standards.
