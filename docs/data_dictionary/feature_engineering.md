# Feature Engineering

The feature engineering module for the Greyhound Racing Predictor system is structured around versioned feature groups, each encapsulating specific aspects of race data analysis.

## Feature Groups

### V3 Distance Stats Features
- Analyzes performance statistics based on racing distance.
- Computes trends and patterns relevant for prediction models.

### V3 Recent Form Features
- Provides insights into the recent performance and form of dogs.
- Utilizes historical race data to craft feature sets.

### V3 Venue Analysis Features
- Studies venue-specific performance metrics.
- Examines adaptability and performance linked to racing venues.

### V3 Box Position Features
- Analyzes advantages and statistics related to starting box positions.
- Integrates historical positional data to enhance predictions.

### V3 Competition Features
- Measures competition level and analyzes field dynamics.
- Incorporates metrics on the field rank and race conditions.

### V3 Weather Track Features
- Considers the impact of weather and track conditions on performance.
- Integrates real-time weather data into feature development.

### V3 Trainer Features
- Assesses trainer and ownership patterns influencing race outcomes.
- Considers historical trainer performance metrics.

## Implementation Details
- **Version Control**: Each feature group is isolated and versioned for maintainability.
- **Integration**: Features are integrated into a unified feature store, allowing for version tracking and drift detection.
- **Drift Detection**: A module to monitor and alert on feature changes that may affect model performance.

The feature engineering module is crucial for transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that fuel the prediction models for accurate and reliable greyhound race predictions.
