# Model Governance: Champion/Challenger

This document provides guidelines for implementing model governance with champion/challenger strategies in the Greyhound Racing Predictor.

## Overview

Model governance involves systematically managing model deployment, monitoring, promotion, and rollback processes. It ensures that models provide optimal predictions while adhering to operational and business standards.

## Champion/Challenger Strategy

- **Champion Model**: The current best-performing model in production. It has proven reliable and accurate.
- **Challenger Model**: A new model under evaluation. It competes against the champion for the possibility of a promotion.
- **Promotion Criteria**: A threshold for key metrics such as ROC AUC determines whether a challenger can replace the champion.
- **Rollback**: An automated mechanism to revert to a previous champion model if the current champion degrades in performance.

## Promotion Process

1. Train new models and designate them as challengers.
2. Evaluate challenger models against validation data.
3. If a challenger model shows superior performance, promote it to champion.
4. Backup the current champion before promotion.

## Rollback Process

1. Continuously monitor the live performance of the champion model using backtesting and real-time data.
2. If performance degrades below acceptable thresholds, trigger automated rollback.
3. Restore the backup of the previous champion model.

## Monitoring

Establish continuous monitoring for:
- **Model Accuracy**: Regular checks to ensure prediction accuracy.
- **Data Drift**: Monitoring for changes in input data patterns.
- **Model Drift**: Monitoring for changes in model prediction patterns.

## Implementation

- Leverage existing monitoring systems to track key metrics and performance indicators.
- Automate evaluation and rollout processes using scripts to minimize manual intervention.

## Best Practices

- Regularly update models to adapt to new data and trends.
- Maintain transparency in model decisions and governance actions.
- Continuously review promotion and rollback policies to align with business objectives.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Model Evaluation**: Frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for model assessment.
- **Version Control**: Git and related tools for managing code and model versions.
- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines to streamline changes.
