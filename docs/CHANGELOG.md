  - Fixed feature engineering pipeline compatibility with unified database schema
  - Restored proper error handling and logging throughout prediction workflows
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for prediction failures

- **Flask API Endpoints**:
  - Fixed `/api/predict` and `/api/predict_single_race_enhanced` endpoints
  - Resolved database connection issues causing API failures
  - Added proper request validation and error responses
  - Implemented comprehensive API testing suite

- **Data Integration Issues**:
  - Fixed race data ingestion pipeline after database unification
  - Resolved duplicate data handling and prevention mechanisms
  - Corrected venue mapping and race metadata processing
  - Fixed weather data integration and API connectivity

### Changed

  - Enhanced error response structure with detailed diagnostic information
  - Added new fields to race prediction responses: `model_confidence`, `feature_importance`, `betting_strategy`
  - Deprecated legacy prediction endpoints (marked for removal in v4.0.0)

### Added

- **Enhanced Monitoring**:
  - Comprehensive logging system for prediction pipeline performance
  - Database integrity monitoring and automated repair suggestions
  - API endpoint health checks and performance metrics
  - Model accuracy tracking and drift detection

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - End-to-end integration tests for complete prediction workflows

## [v3.0.0] - 2025-07-26 - Major System Unification

*Previous changelog entries preserved from root CHANGELOG.md*

### Added

- **Unified Database Schema**:
  - Introduced a single SQLite database (`greyhound_racing_data.db`) to consolidate all historical, race, and dog data.
  - Created `create_unified_database.py` to build and populate the new schema from legacy data sources.

- **Unified Prediction System**:
  - Developed `unified_predictor.py`, a new core prediction engine that intelligently selects the best available prediction method based on available system components.
  - Implemented `prediction_pipeline_v3.py`, a state-of-the-art machine learning pipeline with advanced feature engineering, data validation, and model management.

- **Enhanced Flask API (`app.py`)**:
  - **New Prediction Endpoint**: Added `/api/predict_single_race_enhanced`, which automatically enriches input data and runs the most advanced prediction pipeline available.
  - **Detailed Data Endpoints**:
    - `/api/dogs/search`: Search for greyhounds.
    - `/api/dogs/<dog_name>/details`: Get comprehensive statistics and performance history for a specific dog.
    - `/api/races/paginated`: A powerful endpoint for browsing historical races with search, sorting, and pagination.
  - **System Management**: Added endpoints for monitoring logs, managing data processing workflows, and viewing model performance.

- **Configuration & Stability**:
  - Introduced `UnifiedPredictorConfig` to centralize all paths, feature names, and system settings.
  - Implemented caching for prediction results to improve performance.
  - Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms across the entire stack.

### Changed

- **Project Structure**:
  - Reorganized the project by moving dozens of outdated, redundant, and test-specific scripts into the `archive/` directory to clean up the root folder.
  - Standardized file naming and module structures for better clarity.

- **Data Processing**:
  - The `run.py` script and background processing tasks in `app.py` were updated to work with the new unified database and prediction system.

### Recommendations for Future Development

- **TypeScript Migration**: Consider migrating frontend JavaScript to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and development experience
- **Alembic Integration**: Implement Alembic for database schema versioning and migration management
- **Containerization**: Add Docker support for consistent deployment environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Add production monitoring with metrics and alerting systems
