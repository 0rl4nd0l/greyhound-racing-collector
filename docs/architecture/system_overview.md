# System Overview

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the Greyhound Racing Predictor. It details the design, components, and interaction between different parts of the system.

## Design

The Greyhound Racing Predictor is a Flask-based web application that predicts race outcomes using machine learning models.

## Components

- **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests and serves the user interface.
- **Model Server**: Hosts the machine learning models and serves predictions.
- **Database**: Stores race data, model metrics, and other application data.
- **Monitoring**: Collects and displays system performance metrics using Prometheus.
