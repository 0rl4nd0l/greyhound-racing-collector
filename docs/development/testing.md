# Testing Guidelines

Comprehensive testing ensures the robustness and reliability of the Greyhound Racing Predictor system. This document provides guidelines for unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.

## Unit Testing

### Objectives
- Validate individual components for correctness.
- Provide immediate feedback on breaking changes.

### Tools
- **Pytest**: Used for writing and executing unit tests.
- **Mock**: Employed to simulate complex dependencies.

### Test Structure
- **Arrange**: Set up the test environment.
- **Act**: Execute the function or component.
- **Assert**: Verify the result against expected outcomes.

### Example
```python
import pytest
from example_module import compute_sum

def test_compute_sum():
    # Arrange
    a, b = 5, 10
    expected = 15

    # Act
    result = compute_sum(a, b)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected
```

### Coverage
Aim for over 90% code coverage to ensure most code is tested.

## Integration Testing

### Objectives
- Validate interaction between multiple components.
- Detect interface mismatches and communication issues.

### Tools
- **Postman/Newman**: For API integration tests.
- **Selenium**: Used for web interface testing.

### Test Scenarios
- **API Contracts**: Verify all endpoints behave as specified.
- **Database Interactions**: Validate data integrity and transactions.

## Performance Testing

### Objectives
- Assess system performance under expected load.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.

### Tools
- **Locust**: For load testing and establishing baseline performance.
- **cProfile & Scalene**: For profiling and memory analysis.

### Strategies
- **Load Testing**: Simulate multiple users accessing the system.
- **Stress Testing**: Measure system's endurance by increasing load.

## Continuous Integration

### Objectives
- Identify defects early with automated testing processes.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing and deployment workflows.

### Guidelines
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linting and basic tests before committing.
- **CI Pipelines**: Automate tests with each commit and deploy only if all pass successfully.

By following these testing guidelines, the development team ensures the Greyhound Racing Predictor remains high-quality, robust, and functional across updates and feature expansions.
