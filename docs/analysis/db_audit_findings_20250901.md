# Database Audit Findings Report
## Date: September 1, 2025

## Executive Summary ‚úÖ‚ùå

The greyhound racing database audit has revealed both **successes** and **critical data integrity issues** that require immediate attention.

### Critical Issues Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Alembic Migration Conflicts**: Successfully merged conflicting heads and restored clean migration state
- **Empty Production Tables**: Migrated 29,751 records from staging to production tables using `migrate_real_data.py`
- **Missing Foreign Key Indexes**: Added critical performance indexes for `enhanced_expert_data` table

### Critical Issues Identified ‚ùå
- **Significant Data Duplication**: 7,636 box number duplicates and 223 dog name duplicates
- **Data Integrity Violations**: 1,108 races with multiple winners, 1,451 races without winners
- **Incomplete Winner Data**: Only 28.58% of races have winner information populated

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Migration and Schema Status ‚úÖ
- **Migration State**: Clean single head after resolving conflicts
- **Foreign Key Enforcement**: Enabled and functioning
- **Referential Integrity**: 0 orphaned records found
- **New Indexes Created**:
  - `idx_enhanced_expert_data_race_id` on enhanced_expert_data(race_id)
  - `idx_enhanced_expert_data_race_dog` on enhanced_expert_data(race_id, dog_clean_name)

### 2. Data Volume and Coverage
| Table | Records | Unique Race IDs | Coverage |
|-------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| race_metadata | 3,583 | 3,583 | 100% |
| dog_race_data | 29,751 | 3,583 | 100% |
| enhanced_expert_data | 29,751 | 3,583 | 100% |

### 3. Data Quality Issues ‚ùå

#### Critical Duplication Problems
- **Box Number Duplicates**: 7,636 cases where multiple dogs have same box number in same race
- **Dog Name Duplicates**: 223 cases where same dog appears multiple times in same race
- **Multiple Winners**: 1,108 races incorrectly have multiple dogs with finish_position = 1

#### Data Completeness Issues
- **Missing Winners**: 71.42% of races (2,559 out of 3,583) lack winner information
- **Missing Sectional Times**: 27.23% of expert records lack sectional timing data
- **Races Without Any Winners**: 1,451 races have no dogs marked as winners

#### Data Consistency Status ‚úÖ
- **Box Numbers**: All within valid range (1-10)
- **Finish Positions**: All positive values
- **PIR Ratings**: 100% completeness in enhanced_expert_data

### 4. Query Performance ‚úÖ
- **Index Coverage**: Adequate for core operations
- **Query Plans**: Efficient use of composite indexes in common JOIN patterns
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: All critical relationships now properly indexed

## Business Impact Assessment

### High Priority Issues üî¥
1. **Race Result Integrity**: Multiple winners per race violates fundamental business rules
2. **Betting Data Reliability**: Missing winner data affects 71% of races
3. **Feature Engineering Impact**: Duplicates will skew ML model training data

### Medium Priority Issues üü°
1. **Performance Optimization**: Additional indexes may be needed for specific query patterns
2. **Data Pipeline Monitoring**: Need automated validation to prevent future duplication

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Create Unique Constraints**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dog_race_data ADD CONSTRAINT unique_box_per_race 
   UNIQUE(race_id, box_number);
   
   ALTER TABLE dog_race_data ADD CONSTRAINT unique_dog_per_race 
   UNIQUE(race_id, dog_clean_name);
   ```

2. **Data Cleanup Script**: 
   - Identify and resolve duplicate entries using deterministic rules
   - Implement winner detection logic to populate missing winner_name fields
   - Validate race results to ensure exactly one winner per race

3. **Add Business Rule Constraints**:
   - Ensure exactly one finish_position = 1 per race
   - Add check constraints for valid box numbers and positions

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Enhanced Data Validation Pipeline**:
   - Add pre-ingestion duplicate detection
   - Implement automated business rule validation
   - Create data quality monitoring dashboard

2. **Complete Winner Data Population**:
   - Run backfill process to identify winners from finish_position data
   - Validate against race scraping results where available

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. **Comprehensive Data Pipeline Overhaul**:
   - Implement staging-to-production promotion with validation
   - Add automated data quality tests in CI/CD
   - Create data lineage tracking system

## Query Performance Analysis

### Optimized Query Plans ‚úÖ
Critical joins now use composite indexes effectively:
```
SEARCH e USING INDEX idx_enhanced_expert_data_race_dog (race_id=? AND dog_clean_name=?)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Feature Building Queries**: Now use optimal index access paths
- **Historical Data Lookups**: Efficient composite index utilization
- **Temporal Consistency Checks**: Ready for implementation

## Data Pipeline Status

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- CSV ingestion to staging tables
- Staging to production migration via `migrate_real_data.py`
- Foreign key relationships and enforcement

### Areas Requiring Attention ‚ùå
- Data validation and deduplication during ingestion
- Winner identification and population process
- Automated data quality monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Data Cleanup** (Priority 1)
2. **Add Unique Constraints** (Priority 1)  
3. **Enhance Data Validation Pipeline** (Priority 2)
4. **Complete Remaining Audit Tasks** (Priority 3)

The database is functional for basic operations but requires significant data cleanup before being suitable for production ML model training.
