"""
Inspect a serialized sklearn pipeline/model to extract the exact feature names it expects
and save a contract JSON with an ordered feature list.

Usage:
  python inspect_model_features.py --model-path ./model_registry/models/<artifact>.joblib \
    [--output ./docs/model_contracts/<contract_name>.json]

Defaults:
  - If --output is omitted, a file will be written under docs/model_contracts using the
    model artifact stem, e.g., V4_GradientBoosting_..._model.json -> V4_GradientBoosting_..._model.json
