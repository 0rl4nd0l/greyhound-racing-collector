# The Greyhound Recorder (TGR) Prediction Integration

## Overview

The Greyhound Recorder (TGR) has been successfully integrated into the prediction pipeline to provide rich historical form data for dogs during predictions. This enhancement significantly improves prediction accuracy by leveraging TGR's comprehensive form guides and historical performance data.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **TGRPredictionIntegrator** (`tgr_prediction_integration.py`)
   - Core integration class that handles TGR data lookup
   - Provides 18 specialized TGR features for each dog
   - Implements caching for performance optimization
   - Maintains temporal integrity (no future data leakage)

2. **TemporalFeatureBuilder Enhancement** (`temporal_feature_builder.py`)
   - Automatically initializes TGR integration
   - Seamlessly incorporates TGR features during feature building
   - Maintains all existing temporal safeguards

3. **ML System V4 Integration** (`ml_system_v4.py`)
   - Imports TGR integration automatically
   - Uses TGR-enhanced features for predictions
   - No changes required to prediction API

## TGR Features

The following 18 TGR features are now available for each dog during predictions:

### Basic Form Features
- `tgr_total_races` - Total number of TGR races found
- `tgr_recent_races` - Number of recent races (last 10)
- `tgr_avg_finish_position` - Average finishing position
- `tgr_best_finish_position` - Best finishing position
- `tgr_win_rate` - Percentage of wins
- `tgr_place_rate` - Percentage of top-3 finishes

### Performance Analysis
- `tgr_consistency` - Performance consistency score
- `tgr_form_trend` - Recent form trend (positive = improving)
- `tgr_recent_avg_position` - Average position in recent races
- `tgr_recent_best_position` - Best position in recent races

### Distance & Venue Analysis
- `tgr_preferred_distance` - Most successful distance
- `tgr_preferred_distance_avg` - Average position at preferred distance
- `tgr_preferred_distance_races` - Number of races at preferred distance
- `tgr_venues_raced` - Number of different venues raced at

### Temporal Features
- `tgr_days_since_last_race` - Days since most recent TGR race
- `tgr_last_race_position` - Position in most recent race

### Expert Analysis
- `tgr_has_comments` - Number of races with expert comments
- `tgr_sentiment_score` - Sentiment analysis of expert comments

## Integration Points

### During Prediction Pipeline

1. **Feature Building Phase**
   ```python
   # TGR features are automatically added during temporal feature building
   features = temporal_builder.build_features_for_race(race_data, race_id)
   # Result includes both standard historical features + 18 TGR features
   ```

2. **ML Model Training**
   - TGR features are included in training data automatically
   - No changes required to existing training pipeline
   - Models learn to utilize TGR insights alongside other features

3. **Prediction Generation**
   - TGR features enhance prediction accuracy
   - All predictions now benefit from TGR form analysis
   - Maintains same prediction API format

## Performance & Caching

### Caching Strategy
- TGR features are cached for 24 hours by default
- Cache duration configurable via `cache_duration_hours` parameter
- Reduces API calls to TGR and improves prediction speed

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `gr_dog_form` and `expert_form_analysis` tables
- Falls back to default features when no TGR data available
- Temporal queries ensure no future data leakage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration Check
```python
from tgr_prediction_integration import TGRPredictionIntegrator

# Initialize TGR integrator
integrator = TGRPredictionIntegrator()

# Check available features
features = integrator.get_feature_names()
print(f"Available TGR features: {len(features)}")
```

### Prediction with TGR Enhancement
```python
from ml_system_v4 import MLSystemV4

# Initialize ML system (TGR integration is automatic)
ml_system = MLSystemV4()

# Make prediction (now includes TGR features automatically)
result = ml_system.predict_race(race_data, race_id)
```

### Manual TGR Feature Access
```python
from datetime import datetime
from tgr_prediction_integration import TGRPredictionIntegrator

integrator = TGRPredictionIntegrator()

# Get TGR features for specific dog
dog_name = "BALLARAT STAR"
race_timestamp = datetime(2025, 8, 24, 14, 30)
tgr_features = integrator._get_tgr_historical_features(dog_name, race_timestamp)

print(f"TGR win rate: {tgr_features['tgr_win_rate']:.3f}")
print(f"TGR form trend: {tgr_features['tgr_form_trend']:.3f}")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GREYHOUND_DB_PATH` - Database path for TGR data
- `GREYHOUND_LOOKBACK_DAYS` - Historical lookback period (default: 365 days)

### TGRPredictionIntegrator Options
```python
integrator = TGRPredictionIntegrator(
    db_path="greyhound_racing_data.db",    # Database path
    enable_tgr_lookup=True,                # Enable/disable TGR integration
    cache_duration_hours=24                # Cache duration
)
```
