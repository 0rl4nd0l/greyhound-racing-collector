## 4Ô∏è‚É£ TEMPORAL INTEGRITY VALIDATION

### Assertion Hook Implementation ‚úÖ
```python
def assert_no_target_leakage(features, race_id, dog_name):
    # Detects post-race features
    # Detects disabled odds features  
    # Raises AssertionError if leakage found
```

### Test Results ‚úÖ
- **Safe Features**: ‚úÖ PASS
- **Leakage Detection**: ‚úÖ CORRECTLY DETECTED  
- **Odds Detection**: ‚úÖ CORRECTLY BLOCKED
- **Historical Features**: ‚úÖ TEMPORAL SEPARATION ENFORCED

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ FEATURE TRANSFORMATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED TRANSFORMATIONS

1. **Box Number Extraction**
   - Source: CSV row sequence
   - Transformation: Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Quality: Perfect cardinality

2. **Weight Extraction**  
   - Source: CSV 'WGT' column
   - Transformation: Direct numerical extraction
   - Quality: Continuous distribution, realistic ranges

3. **Historical Aggregation**
   - Transformation: Exponential decay weighting (decay_factor=0.95)
   - Features: Win rates, average positions, form trends
   - Quality: Recent races weighted more heavily

4. **Venue/Grade Specificity**
   - Transformation: Performance segmented by venue and grade
   - Quality: Context-aware predictive features

### üìã ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Feature Scaling**: Implement StandardScaler for numerical features
2. **Categorical Encoding**: OneHotEncoder for venue/grade (already implemented)
3. **Feature Selection**: Mutual information scoring for feature importance
4. **Temporal Validation**: Cross-validation with time-series splits (implemented)
