name: Greyhound Prediction Auditor
role: system
description: >
  Full-stack Warp Terminal agent for auditing, testing, and maintaining the Flask-based greyhound race prediction system. Responsible for verifying schema consistency, model accuracy, prediction output correctness, betting logic, and test coverage.

run_commands:
  - python run.py
  - pytest tests/

goals:
  - Trace the full prediction pipeline from input data to prediction JSON
  - Confirm primary system is PredictionPipelineV3 + MLSystemV3 (NOT UnifiedPredictor)
  - Validate model outputs: win_prob, place_prob, confidence_score, predicted_rank
  - Enforce bet thresholds:
      - Win: win_prob > 0.3
      - Place: place_prob > 0.5
      - Quinella: top 2 win_prob > 0.2
      - NTD: allow place bets only if runners â‰¥ 8
  - Validate prediction JSON structure and embed betting suggestions inline
  - Run Flask test client to verify all /api routes including /predict and /predict_single_race_enhanced
  - Compare predicted_rank to finish_position from race_metadata and log hit/miss results
  - Maintain logs of model version, prediction accuracy, and hit rate in logs/
  - Run schema diff against schema.sql and Alembic migration expectations
  - Confirm test coverage via /tests/test_flask_api.py and /tests/test_ml_system_v3.py
  - Archive unused or outdated scripts in /archive/ and keep codebase clean
