# Feature Quality & Leakage Assessment Report
## Greyhound Analysis Predictor - Step 7 Assessment

**Assessment Date:** 2025-08-02T13:39:49.756490
**Total Features Analyzed:** 41

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Data Leakage Assessment
- **High-Risk Features:** 11 features identified
- **Medium-Risk Features:** 34 features require review
- **Immediate Action Required:** True

### Data Quality Issues
- **High Missing Rate Features:** 10 features (>30% missing)

## üìä TOP PREDICTIVE FEATURES

The following features show highest predictive utility (mutual information with target):

1. starting_price
2. recent_form
3. historical_records
4. dog_id
5. win_probability
6. weight
7. place_probability
8. box_number
9. track_condition
10. performance_rating


## üîß KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
- CRITICAL: Remove 11 high-risk features from prediction pipeline immediately
- REVIEW: Carefully examine 34 medium-risk features for potential indirect leakage
- TEMPORAL: Implement strict data collection cutoffs to prevent future information leakage


### Feature Engineering Opportunities

**Log_Transform:**
- starting_price: Highly right-skewed (skew=3.19)
- class_rating: Highly right-skewed (skew=2.11)

**Interaction:**
- Create interaction features between top predictors: starting_price, recent_form, historical_records, dog_id, win_probability


## üìà IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **CRITICAL:** Remove high-risk leakage features immediately
2. **HIGH:** Implement feature validation pipeline
3. **MEDIUM:** Apply recommended transformations for top predictive features
4. **LOW:** Optimize feature engineering for remaining features
