# Workflow Log - Dependency Verification

## Step 2: Optional dependency verification - 2025-08-03 17:26:46

### Import Test Results:
1. **shap**: ❌ FAILED - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shap'
2. **xgboost**: ❌ FAILED - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xgboost'
3. **evidently**: ❌ FAILED - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'evidently'

### Actions Taken:
1. **Dependencies Found in requirements.txt**: ✅ All three packages were already listed in requirements.txt
2. **Installation**: ✅ Successfully installed all packages via `pip install shap xgboost evidently`
3. **Post-Installation Import Tests**:
   - **shap**: ✅ SUCCESS - Imported successfully
   - **xgboost**: ✅ SUCCESS - Imported successfully  
   - **evidently**: ❌ FAILED - ImportError due to pydantic compatibility issue (TypeError: multiple bases have instance lay-out conflict)

### Summary:
- 2 out of 3 optional dependencies are now working correctly (shap, xgboost)
- 1 dependency (evidently) has compatibility issues but is installed
- All dependencies were successfully added to the environment
- No modifications to requirements.txt were needed as dependencies were already listed

### Notes:
- The evidently package has a known compatibility issue with the current pydantic version
- This may need to be addressed in a future dependency update cycle
- For now, shap and xgboost are functional for ML model explainability and gradient boosting tasks
