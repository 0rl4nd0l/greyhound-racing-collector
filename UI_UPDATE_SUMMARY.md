# UI Update Complete: Clear Comprehensive Statistics âœ…

## Summary of Changes

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully completed comprehensive UI updates for clearer data representation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

### Before Update:
- **Confusing Statistics**: UI showed "32 total and 11 processed" which was misleading
- **Hidden Enhanced Data**: 6,536+ enhanced CSV files and 6,536+ JSON files weren't clearly visible
- **Database Disconnect**: UI didn't properly represent the 767 races in the database
- **File Category Confusion**: Basic workflow files vs enhanced data files weren't distinguished

### After Update:
- **Clear Comprehensive View**: All data types properly categorized and displayed
- **Enhanced Data Highlighted**: Prominently shows 6,536+ enhanced files as the main data asset
- **Database Integration**: Clearly shows 767 races in database with proper statistics
- **Logical Categorization**: Separates basic workflow files (32) from enhanced data (13,000+)
