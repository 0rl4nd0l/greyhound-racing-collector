   - Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Implement automated testing and deployment workflows
   - Add code quality checks and automated security scanning
   - Enable continuous integration and deployment

5. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Integrate Prometheus metrics and alerting systems
   - Add comprehensive application performance monitoring
   - Implement distributed tracing and log aggregation

## API Contract Changes

### New Endpoint: `/api/health`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive system health monitoring for production deployment

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T19:00:00Z",
  "version": "3.1.1",
  "components": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "ml_system": "available",
    "weather_service": "operational"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables automated health checks in production
- Provides detailed component-level diagnostics
- Supports monitoring automation and alerting
- Critical for deployment validation and system monitoring

## System State After Step 5
