## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integration Strategy:

#### 1. Data Collection Service
```python
class BOMWeatherService:
    """Main weather data collection service"""
    
    def get_current_weather(venue_code: str) -> WeatherData:
        """Fetch current conditions for venue"""
        
    def get_forecast_weather(venue_code: str, date: str) -> WeatherData:
        """Fetch forecast for specific race date"""
        
    def bulk_update_weather(race_list: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        """Update weather for multiple upcoming races"""
```

#### 2. Database Schema
```sql
-- Core weather data table
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    venue_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    race_date DATE NOT NULL,
    temperature REAL,
    humidity REAL,
    wind_speed REAL,
    wind_direction TEXT,
    precipitation REAL,
    pressure REAL,
    condition TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    data_source TEXT,
    collection_timestamp DATETIME,
    UNIQUE(venue_code, race_date)
);

-- Weather impact analysis
CREATE TABLE weather_impact_analysis (
    venue_code TEXT,
    weather_condition TEXT,
    temperature_range TEXT,
    avg_winning_time REAL,
    favorite_strike_rate REAL,
    sample_size INTEGER,
    last_updated DATETIME
);
```

```python
def calculate_weather_adjustment(weather_data: WeatherData, venue: str) -> float:
    """Calculate weather-based prediction adjustment factor"""
    
    base_factor = 1.0
    
    # Temperature adjustments
    if weather_data.temperature > 30:
        base_factor *= 0.92  # Hot weather penalty
    elif weather_data.temperature < 10:
        base_factor *= 0.95  # Cold weather penalty
    
    # Precipitation adjustments  
    if weather_data.precipitation > 5:
        base_factor *= 0.90  # Heavy rain penalty
    elif weather_data.precipitation > 0:
        base_factor *= 0.95  # Light rain penalty
    
    # Wind adjustments
    if weather_data.wind_speed > 20:
        base_factor *= 0.94  # Strong wind penalty
    
    return max(0.75, min(1.15, base_factor))  # Reasonable bounds
```

## 🎯 Integration with Existing System

### Enhanced Feature Engineering:
The weather service integrates with your existing `enhanced_feature_engineering.py`:

```python
# In _create_contextual_features method:
def _create_contextual_features(self, dog_stats, race_context):
    features = {}
    
    # Existing features...
    
    # Enhanced weather integration
    weather_data = self.weather_service.get_weather_for_race(
        race_context['venue'], 
        race_context['race_date']
    )
    
    if weather_data:
        # Temperature suitability (enhanced)
        features['temperature_suitability'] = self._calculate_temp_suitability(
            weather_data.temperature, race_context['venue']
        )
        
        # New weather features
        features['precipitation_impact'] = self._calculate_precipitation_impact(
            weather_data.precipitation
        )
        
        features['wind_adjustment'] = self._calculate_wind_impact(
            weather_data.wind_speed, weather_data.wind_direction
        )
        
        features['weather_severity_score'] = self._calculate_severity_score(
            weather_data
        )
    
    return features
```

### Prediction System Enhancement:
```python
# In prediction pipeline:
def enhance_predictions_with_weather(predictions: List[Dict], race_context: Dict):
    """Apply weather adjustments to base predictions"""
    
    weather_data = weather_service.get_weather_for_race(
        race_context['venue'], 
        race_context['race_date']
    )
    
    if weather_data:
        adjustment_factor = weather_service.calculate_weather_adjustment_factor(
            weather_data, race_context['venue']
        )
        
        # Apply adjustments to predictions
        for prediction in predictions:
            prediction['weather_adjusted_probability'] = (
                prediction['base_probability'] * adjustment_factor
            )
            prediction['weather_conditions'] = {
                'temperature': weather_data.temperature,
                'condition': weather_data.condition.value,
                'adjustment_factor': adjustment_factor
            }
    
    return predictions
```
