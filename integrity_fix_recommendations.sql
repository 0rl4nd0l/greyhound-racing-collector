-- PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL FIXES (HIGH SEVERITY)
-- =====================================================================

-- 1. POPULATE VENUES TABLE
-- Issue: Empty venues table but 25 venues referenced in races and form_guide
-- Impact: Breaks referential integrity for venue relationships

-- 2. ADD MISSING DOGS FROM FORM_GUIDE TO DOGS TABLE
-- Issue: 20 dogs in form_guide are not in dogs table
-- Impact: Inconsistent dog references across tables

INSERT INTO dogs (dog_name, total_races, total_wins, total_places, best_time, average_position, created_at, updated_at)

-- PRIORITY 3: DATA QUALITY FIXES
-- =====================================================================

-- 3. FIX RACE DATE FORMAT ISSUES
-- Issue: Race dates appear to have inconsistent formats
-- Impact: Date-based queries and temporal analysis failures

-- First, let's see the current date format issues:
-- SELECT DISTINCT race_date, COUNT(*) FROM races GROUP BY race_date ORDER BY race_date;

-- Create a backup of current race dates
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS race_date_backup AS 
SELECT race_id, race_date, race_name, venue FROM races;

-- Update race dates to proper format (this would need manual inspection of actual data)
-- Example fix - adjust based on actual data patterns found:
/*
UPDATE races 
SET race_date = CASE 
    WHEN race_date = '01 July 2025' THEN '2025-07-01'
    WHEN race_date = '02 July 2025' THEN '2025-07-02'
    -- Add more mappings based on actual data
    ELSE race_date
END
WHERE race_date NOT LIKE '____-__-__';
*/

-- 4. FIX BOX NUMBER INCONSISTENCIES  
-- Issue: 10 races have box numbers > 8 or duplicate box numbers
-- Impact: Invalid race configurations

-- Create backup of problematic races
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS box_number_issues_backup AS
SELECT dp.*, r.race_name, r.venue, r.race_date
FROM dog_performances dp
JOIN races r ON dp.race_id = r.race_id
WHERE dp.race_id IN (
    SELECT race_id 
    FROM dog_performances 
    WHERE box_number > 8 OR box_number < 1
    GROUP BY race_id
);

-- Fix box numbers > 8 by normalizing to 1-8 range
UPDATE dog_performances 
SET box_number = CASE 
    WHEN box_number = 9 THEN 1
    WHEN box_number = 10 THEN 2
    ELSE box_number 
END 
WHERE box_number > 8;

-- For duplicate box numbers in same race, reassign sequentially
-- This requires a more complex script - creating a separate procedure

-- =====================================================================

-- 5. TRAINER DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY
-- Issue: 100% missing trainer information
-- Recommendation: Manual data collection or web scraping from original sources

-- Create trainer table structure for future data
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trainers (
    trainer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    trainer_name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    location TEXT,
    license_number TEXT,
    total_dogs INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_wins INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    win_rate REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add trainer_id foreign key to dog_performances (optional)
-- ALTER TABLE dog_performances ADD COLUMN trainer_id INTEGER REFERENCES trainers(trainer_id);
